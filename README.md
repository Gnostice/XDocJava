# XtremeDocumentStudio for Java
Gnostice XtremeDocumentStudio (for Java) is the next-generation multi-format document-processing component suite for J2SE/J2EE developers. Currently, it supports viewing, printing, and converting PDF, DOCX, BMP, JPEG, PNG, JPEG2000 and single-page/multi-page TIFF.

XtremeDocumentStudio can process PDF and DOCX without requiring external software such as Microsoft Word, Open XML SDK, Adobe PDF library or GhostScript. (For supporting advanced image formats such as JPEG2000 or TIFF, the library Java Advanced Imaging is required. For processing simple image formats such as BMP, PNG or JPEG, the Java Advanced Imaging library is not required.) When converting to PDF (on Windows), XtremeDocumentStudio can perform OCR text recognition on raster images and create corresponding searchable/selectable PDF text elements.
